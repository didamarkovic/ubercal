Tests the possiblity of performing uber-cal to achieve the required relative spectro-photometric calibration

make create-euclid-patch
./create-euclid-patch

make create-euclid-survey
./create-euclid-survey

make test-calibration
./test-calibration


Current assumptions:

Assumes Euclidean geometry over survey
Assumes Calibrator densities and SNR do not vary over survey
Uses binned stellar densities
